    This project explores the iterative frustrations of AI-generated content through a satirical Yonkoma comic, highlighting AI’s frequent hallucinations and the psychological rollercoaster that comes with addressing them. The comic uses humor to showcase the disconnect between pre-trained unbiased logic, AI-generated "failures" and human expectations.

Figure 1. My Yonkoma satirizes the iterative loop of generative AI. The artist eagerly explains fixing an AI-generated hand, spiraling into an overwhelming monologue. While the hand is corrected, the final panel humorously exposes a new issue with the artist's legs, emphasizing AI’s endless cycle of iterative exploration.

<!-- Abstract -->
## Abstract
A satirical showcase of generative AI’s tendency to misinterpret human intent, often overcorrecting or hallucinating unexpected results. It explores the gap between AI’s structured, pre-trained logic and subjective human expectations, highlighting issues like bias, prompt "failure," and human psychological responses to iterative AI-driven tools.

### Inspiration

Figure 2. My Yonkoma draws inspiration from this segment within Big Nate [4], an American comic strip, which subtly breaks the 4th wall.

## Introduction and Related Works

Generative AI tools have become widely used for art, text generation, and creative workflows, yet they often struggle with misinterpretation, overcorrection, and unintended distortions. This issue is particularly evident in AI image generation, where users must refine prompts iteratively to achieve desired results—often encountering unexpected biases, distortions, or hallucinations in the process.

A major issue is AI hallucinations, where models generate inaccurate or exaggerated details. Research on AI-generated hands shows that models often produce extra fingers, unnatural anatomy, and distorted proportions, highlighting how AI struggles with complex structures and proportional accuracy [1].

Beyond technical issues, user psychology influences how AI failures are perceived. Studies on automation bias and algorithmic aversion reveal that users tend to over-rely on AI or lose trust after mistakes, depending on how much control they feel over AI corrections [2]. This psychological factor is crucial in understanding why users continuously refine prompts despite repeated failures.

The prompt refinement struggle is further explored in studies on user interaction with text-to-image models, which highlight common frustrations and the need for more intuitive AI interfaces [3]. These works underscore the disconnect between AI logic and human expectations, a theme central to this project’s satirical exploration.


### Built With
* ChatGPT
* Anitoon.app's "AI Comic Generator" and "Create Comic on Canvas" pages
* Adobe Photoshop

## Methodology

### Creative Workflow

The comic was created using Anitoon.app's AI Comic Generator, an AI-powered tool designed to streamline comic creation. The process involved several stages of iteration and refinement to achieve the desired visual style and narrative clarity.

* Step 1: After developing a prompt using ChatGPT, use the Anitoon.app's "Comic-Generator" page to generate multiple 2x2 panel iterations, experimenting with different styles.
* Step 2: Once satisfied with the general style, transferred the comic to the "Create Comic on Canvas" page, allowing for individual panel modifications through isolated AI generations. The use of layered shapes and text help mitigate artifacts and allowed for greater flexibility in iterative refinements.
* Step 3: Exported the final AI-generated panels to Photoshop, where manual edits were made to ensure stylistic cohesion, correct inconsistencies, and refine details that AI misinterpreted.

Figure 5. Breakdown of iterative AI generations per panel, refining coherence and accuracy. Panel 1’s high iteration count illustrates the loop trap of subjective regeneration. Reevaluation of expectations and user-control result in quicker iterations of later panels.

### Challenges & Iterative Process

* Maintaining style consistency across panels.
* Ensuring intended character expressions and proportions.
* Intentionally producing generated hand hallucinations and distortions.


### Tools & Techniques Used

* AI-models: Chat-GPT; Anitoon.app AI Comic Generator (model specifics undisclosed).
* Post-processing software: Adobe Photoshop for manual refinements.
* Prompting strategies: Iterative AI generations, isolated panel adjustments, and selective negative prompts to refine details.



## Result and Future Work
The final Yonkoma successfully illustrates the frustrations of AI-driven art generation, emphasizing the gap between user intent and AI execution. Each panel showcases common AI pitfalls:
* Misinterpretation – AI generates incorrect anatomy.
* Overcorrection – The user refines prompts, but AI takes adjustments too literally.
* Temporary Success – The correction seems to work.
* Unintended Failure – Fixing one issue causes another absurd problem.

### Future Work
* Expanding beyond Yonkoma to explore longer-form AI generated comics and stories.
* Experimenting with different AI models and tools.
* Further exploring modular revision techniques for UI integration.
* Investigating user perception of AI-generated failures through surveys or user testing.



## Conclusion
This project highlights the struggle of iterating and refining AI-generated content, using humor to emphasize the disconnect between user intent, expectation, and AI execution. As AI tools continue to evolve, understanding its limitations, biases, and unpredictability remains crucial—especially in creative fields where human expectations don’t always align with machine logic.
